Day 5
============
##### Create a simple Todo App
##### You should be able to add new items and use the buttons to toggle completed items, edit items, or delete items.
##### If you try to add an item without text, you should receive an alert telling the user to add an item.
#####  The clear button should clear your page.
##### Data should persist since this app uses local storage.
